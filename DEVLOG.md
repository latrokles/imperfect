I'm trying to collapse all my little experiments and "software/programming studies" under a single repository and document my thought process as well as the things that have prompted me in this direction. Most of the things here will likely be dead ends, but some may end up being somewhat useful to me (this is all personal computing softare).

Doing all these in python just because it's what I have handy and it's fresher in my head, though to be honest a lot of these ideas are better implemente in other languages/tech stacks. I could potentially split this off into languages if I ever feel that way.

Today I just renamed and restructured the package and moved a couple of things from older packages. Also created some empty modules for older experiments I have to refactor and shape up a little to make useful.
